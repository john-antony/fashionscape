## tech stack: MongoDB Atlas, Express, React, Node, AWS, OPENAI, Firebase

I created this website because I wanted to combine my passions of fashion and coding, to create a landscape where designs and looks can be shared online.

I gained valuable experience working with the MERN tech stack:

When a user creates a post, the image is sent to my Amazon S3 bucket, and the post information is stored in MongoDB Atlas.

I make calls to my Express backend to retrieve relevant post or user data.

Firebase is used for secure user authentication.

I integreted OpenAI API to create a custom AI stylist chatbot for fashionscape.
